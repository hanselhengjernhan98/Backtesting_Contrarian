# Backtesting of Contrarian & Momentum Trading Strategies 

__Objectives:__

- Simulate the Strategy with historical data and measure the performance.

__Possible Backtesting Outcomes__:
- low/no profitability -> __Reject Strategy__
- moderate/high profitability -> __further analysis__ (reliability of profits)

Result: Contrarian was bad! Even before trading costs!

Using the same logic, if contrarian strategy were to be bad, let's try the Momentum strategy, where we buy the best performing DJI stock and short the worst performing one. 

Result: Momentum was great! Went from $0 in 2020 and to $8000 in 2022! (Granted this was during the tech boom,  which heavily influences the DJI)
